I am currently a Ph.D. student in Information Science with a concentration in Data Science at UNT advised by [Dr. Brady Lund](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IGZZD-UAAAAJ&hl=en). 

My research explores the ethical development and deployment of AI in healthcare, focusing on how to create Responsible AI and Explainable AI systems that are fair, transparent, and trustworthy. My work at the intersection of AI ethics, health informatics, and biomedical informatics aims to address health disparities and improve clinical decision-making.
